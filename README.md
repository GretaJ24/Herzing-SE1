This week's assessment is to start a GitHub repo for this class named "Herzing SE1". This repo will be where all your code will be placed and how you will be graded. The only thing you will have to turn in will be the link to your GitHub repository. This assessment will get us started with coding in Java and make sure you have your Java IDE up and running.   

The program you will make will be a straightforward rock, paper, scissors program. You can make this as straightforward or as complex as possible, but the following features are a bare minimum.  

The code must run (and a screenshot of the running code in the ReadMe file on GitHub)  
If the terminal/console is not in the screenshot, it will not have worked as it will be considered wrong. 
The game should be two players, so no AI (unless you want that blue ribbon)  
There should be a while loop asking players to either continue playing or stop playing after each round (y/n answer)  
Player input can either be a string or integer to select rack/paper/scissors.  
A tally of wins should be kept, and after the player chooses to end the game, the tally should print out for both players.  
To turn in this homework, submit the link or paste the link into a word document and submit that. All you should turn in is the GitHub Repo link to the file. This assessment will help you learn how to use GitHub and then get your feet wet with Python, our primary programming language in this class.
